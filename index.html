    <p>Assignment 2 s215736, 31-03-2025.</p>

    <p>San Francisco has long grappled with drug and narcotic-related issues, shaped by shifting political approaches over the years. In the early 2000s, policies leaned toward strict enforcement, with a focus on cracking down on drug-related offenses. However, in recent years, there has been a shift toward harm reduction strategies, including safe consumption sites and expanded rehabilitation programs. Despite these efforts, the city continues to face challenges with open-air drug use, fentanyl-related overdoses, and ongoing debates about the balance between public safety and public health.</p>

    <p>This project analyzes drug- and narcotics-related crimes in San Francisco, using various data visualizations to highlight key aspects of the police reports from 2003-2024.</p>

    <p>The data clearly shows that the majority of drug- and narcotics-related crimes in San Francisco occur in the Tenderloin districtâ€”an area known for its high levels of poverty, crime, and homelessness, as well as its ongoing struggle with drug sales and usage.

        The peak of reported drug-related crimes occurred between 2008 and 2009, with nearly 5,000 incidents recorded annually. However, in the following years, these numbers declined significantly until 2018, when drug-related offenses began to rise again. This increase is largely attributed to the fentanyl crisis, which has led to a surge in overdose deaths, making it a severe public health emergency.
        
        Similar trends can be observed in the Southern and Mission districts, though the scale of the issue remains significantly lower compared to the Tenderloin.<p>
    
    <p>The drug crisis has been an ongoing political topic in all of San Francisco. However, the divided political landscape has made it difficult to find consensus on how to effectively combat the drug epidemic. While some push for stricter law enforcement, others argue that criminalizing addiction only worsens the problem. The debate over the balance between public safety, harm reduction, and rehabilitation continues to shape policy decisions in the city.</p>
    
    <p>In general all of San Francisco is affected by drug- and narcotics-related crimes, and it therefore important to note that while certain neighborhoods like the Tenderloin, Southern, and Mission have higher concentrations of drug-related incidents, San Francisco's drug crisis affects multiple areas across the city. Efforts to address these challenges include harm reduction strategies, increased law enforcement, and community-based initiatives</p>
