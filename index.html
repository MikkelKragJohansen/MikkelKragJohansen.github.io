    <p>San Francisco has long grappled with drug and narcotic-related issues, shaped by shifting political approaches over the years. In the early 2000s, policies leaned toward strict enforcement, with a focus on cracking down on drug-related offenses. However, in recent years, there has been a shift toward harm reduction strategies, including safe consumption sites and expanded rehabilitation programs. Despite these efforts, the city continues to face challenges with open-air drug use, fentanyl-related overdoses, and ongoing debates about the balance between public safety and public health.</p>

    <p>This project analyzes drug and narcotic-related crimes in San Francisco, using various data visualizations to highlight key aspects of the police reports from 2003-2024.</p>
